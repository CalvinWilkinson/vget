## **What is it?**
</div>


This is a **GitHub Action** to make it easy to pull versions from XML files.
This can be used in your workflows for other uses such as version validation, version tag management, and more!!

<div align="center"><h3 style="font-weight:bold">üí°Quick Noteüí°</h3></div>

This GitHub action is built using C#/NET and runs in a docker container.  This means that this action can only be ran on linux.  Running in ***windows*** is not supported.  If you need to use steps on windows AND ubuntu, then you can split up your workflow so that this action is part of its own job that runs on ***ubuntu*** while the rest of workflow can be ran with windows.

<div align="center"><h3 style="font-weight:bold">Usage Examples</h3></div>

- Automatically create tags with the version during the release process.
- Validate the version syntax to help enforce version syntax.
  - Example: semantic version vs a date styled version.
- Managing release note file names by having the version embedded in the file name.
- Using the version in the title of a GitHub release.
- Release announcements.
  - Example: Using the version in a release announcement on twitter.
- Status check workflows to verify that the version has been updated before a pull request to perform a major release is completed.
- Whatever your imagination comes up with!!


**Quick Example:**

```yaml
name: Get Version Example

jobs:
  Get_Version_Job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Cannot use windows
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Get Version From C# Project File
      id: get-version
      uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.1
      with:
      repo-owner: JohnDoe
      repo-name: MyRepo
      branch-name: master
      file-type: xml
      file-path: MyProject/MyProject.csproj
      version-keys: Version

    - name: Print Version From File
      id: print-output
      run: echo "${{ steps.get-version.outputs.version }}"
```

So if the C# project file had the contents below, the workflow above would print the value ***1.2.3*** to the GitHub console.

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>
    <Version>1.2.3</Version>
    <FileVersion>0.1.0</FileVersion>
</Project>
```

<div align="center"><h2 style="font-weight:bold">What does it do?</h2></div>

In a nut shell, this pulls out versions from XML data files for use in workflows.
You tell the action which repo, branch, and file that contains the version, and it will search through the file
for the `version-keys` and pull out the value of that key. This value is used as the value of the action's output,
which has the name `version`, so you can use it in the rest of your workflow.

The `version-keys` input is just a comma delimited list of XML keys to search for in the XML file.
For example, if the value of the `version-keys` input was ***"Version,FileVersion"***, than it would search
the XML for any XML elements that match the name ***"Version"*** or ***"FileVersion"***.  The first element that has a value will be the value returned.  So if the XML element ***"Version"*** had a value of ***1.2.3***, than it would simply return the value of the ***"Version"*** element and stop looking for values in any other XML elements.

## **Action Inputs**
</div>

| Input Name | Description | Required | Default Value |
|---|:----|:---:|---|
| `repo-owner` | The owner of the repository | yes | N/A |
| `repo-name` | The name of the repository | yes | N/A |
| `branch-name` | The name of the branch where the file lives. | yes | N/A |
| `file-format` | The type of file that contains the version. Currently the only supported value is `xml`. | yes | N/A |
| `file-path` | The path to the file relative to the root of the repository. | yes | N/A |
| `version-keys` | The key(s) that can possibly hold the version in the file. | yes | N/A |
| `case-sensitive-keys` | If true, key searching will be case sensitive. | no | `true` |
| `fail-on-key-value-mismatch` | If true, will fail the action if all of the key values listed in the `version-keys` input do not match.  Other failure inputs will not affect this input. | no | `false` |
| `fail-when-version-not-found` | If true, will fail the action if no version exists.   Other failure inputs will not affect this input. | no | `true` |

## **Examples**
</div>


**Example 1 - (Pass If Version Not Found):**  
If you do not want to fail the workflow when there is no version found, set the `fail-when-version-not-found` input to a value of `false`.  The input is not required and has a default value of `true`.  This means if you want to prevent the workflow from failing when no version is found, you have to explicitly use the input.

``` yml
#Example 1 Workflow
- name: Get Version From C# Project File
    uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.1
    with:
        repo-owner: JohnDoe
        repo-name: MyRepo
        branch-name: master
        file-type: xml
        file-path: MyProject/MyProject.csproj
        version-keys: Version
        fail-when-version-not-found: false
```
``` xml
<!--Example 1 C# Project File-->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>
    <Version></Version>üëàüèºNo value.  Does not fail workflow.
</Project>
```

**Example 2 - (Multiple Key Searching):**
If you want to search for multiple keys in the file and then fail the workflow if no versions are found, you just need to add all of the keys to the `version-keys` input as a comma delimited list.  Spaces are aloud around each key and will be ignored.  In the example below, the value ***4.5.6*** would be returned.  Since the `fail-when-version-not-found` input is not explicitly used in the YAML, the default value of `true` will be used and the workflow will fail if the version was not found.

``` yml
#Example 2 Workflow
- name: Get Version From C# Project File
    uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.1
    with:
        repo-owner: JohnDoe
        repo-name: MyRepo
        branch-name: master
        file-type: xml
        file-path: MyProject/MyProject.csproj
        version-keys: Version,FileVersion
```
``` xml
<!--Example 2 C# Project File-->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>
    <Version></Version>üëàüèºNo value.  Search continues for FileVersion key
    <FileVersion>4.5.6</FileVersion>üëàüèºKey exists so this value is returned
</Project>
```
