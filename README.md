## **What is it?**
</div>


This is a **GitHub Action** to make it easy to pull versions from XML files.
This can be used in your workflows for other uses such as version validation, version tag management, and more!!


<div align="center"><h3 style="font-weight:bold">‚ö†Ô∏èQuick Note‚ö†Ô∏è</h3></div>

This GitHub action is built using C#/NET and runs in a docker container.  If the job step for running this action is contained in a job that runs on **Windows**, you will need to move the step to a job that runs on **Ubuntu**.  You can split up your jobs to fulfill `runs-on` requirements of the GitHub action. This can be accomplished by moving the step into it's own job.  You can then route the action step outputs to the job outputs and use them throughout the rest of your workflow. For more information, refer to the Github documentation links below:

For more info on step and job outputs, refer to the GitHub documentation links below:
- [Defining outputs for jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs)
- [Setting a step action output parameter](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-output-parameter)
<div align="center"><h3 style="font-weight:bold">Usage Examples</h3></div>

- Create tags automatically with the version, during the release process.
- Validate the version syntax to help enforce version syntax.
  - Example: Semantic version vs. a date-based version.
- Manage release note file names by having the version embedded in the file name.
- Use the version in the title of a GitHub release.
- Release announcements.
  - Example: Use the version in a release announcement on Twitter.
- Use status check workflows to verify versions before a pull request can be completed.
- Whatever your imagination comes up with!!

<div align="center"><h2 style="font-weight:bold">What does it do?</h2></div>

In a nutshell, this pulls versions out of XML data files for use in workflows.
Just tell the action which repo, branch, and file contains the version, and it will search through the file for the `version-keys` and pull out the value of that key. This value is used as the value of the action's output,
which has the name `version`, so you can use it in the rest of your workflow.

The `version-keys` input is just a comma delimited list of XML keys to search for in the XML file.  
Example:  
If the value of the `version-keys` input was ***"Version,FileVersion"***, then it would search
the XML for any XML elements that match the name ***"Version"*** or ***"FileVersion"***.  The first element that has a value will be the value returned.  So if the XML element ***"Version"*** had a value of ***1.2.3***, then it would simply return the value of the ***"Version"*** element and stop looking for values in any other XML elements.

<div align="center"><h3 style="font-weight:bold">Quick Example</h3></div>

```yaml
name: Get Version Example

jobs:
  Get_Version_Job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Cannot use windows
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Get Version From C# Project File
      id: get-version
      uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.2
      with:
      repo-owner: JohnDoe
      repo-name: MyRepo
      repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      branch-name: master
      file-format: xml # Not case sensitive
      file-path: "MyProject/MyProject.csproj"
      version-keys: Version

    - name: Print Version From File
      id: print-output
      run: echo "${{ steps.get-version.outputs.version }}"
```

If the XML file had the contents below, the workflow above would print the value ***1.2.3*** to the GitHub console.

``` xml
<!--Quick Example - C# Project File-->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>
    <Version>1.2.3</Version>
    <FileVersion>0.1.0</FileVersion>
</Project>
```

## **Action Inputs**
</div>

| Input Name | Description | Required | Default Value |
|---|:---|:---:|---|
| `repo-owner` | The owner of the repository. | yes | N/A |
| `repo-name` | The name of the repository. | yes | N/A |
| `repo-token` | The repository or PAT token to use for authorized requests. This action uses the GitHub API to do its job.  This is not required but you will not be able to get very far once the rate limit has been reached.  Refer to [GitHub API Authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#authentication) for more information about request rate limits. | no | empty |
| `branch-name` | The name of the branch where the file lives. | yes | N/A |
| `file-format` | A non case-sensitive value representing the data format of the file that contains the version. Currently, the only supported value is `xml` for a file format. | yes | N/A |
| `file-path` | The path to the file relative to the root of the repository. | yes | N/A |
| `version-keys` | A comma delimited list of keys that hold the version value. Spaces around commas are ignored.  Keys must be wrapped with single or double quotes to be processed properly if more than one key exists. | yes | N/A |
| `case-sensitive-keys` | If true, key searching will be case-sensitive. | no | `true` |
| `trim-start-from-branch` | Will trim the given value from the beginning of the `branch-name` input. | no | empty |
| `fail-on-key-value-mismatch` | If true, the action will fail, if all of the key values listed in the `version-keys` input do not match.  Other failure inputs will not affect this input. | no | `false` |
| `fail-when-version-not-found` | If true, the action will fail, if no version exists.   Other failure inputs will not affect this input. | no | `true` |

## **Examples**
</div>

<div align="center">

### **Example 1 - (Pass When Version Is Not Found)**
</div>

Requirements:
- Searches for a version but does not fail the workflow if no version is found.

üìíQuick Note: The action input `fail-when-version-not-found` is not required and has a default value of `true`.  If you do not want the action to fail when the version is not found, you must explicitly use the input with a value of `false`.

``` yml
#Example 1 Workflow
- name: Get Version From C# Project File
    uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.2
    with:
        repo-owner: JohnDoe
        repo-name: MyRepo
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        branch-name: master
        file-format: xml # Not case sensitive
        file-path: "MyProject/MyProject.csproj"
        version-keys: Version
        fail-when-version-not-found: false
```
``` xml
<!--Example 1 - C# Project File-->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>
    <Version></Version> <!--No value.  Does not fail workflow.-->
</Project>
```

<div align="center">

### **Example 2 - (Multiple Key Searching)**
</div>

Requirements:
- Searches multiple keys for the version.
- The job fails if no version is found in the keys.

Result:  
- The example below will use the value of ***4.5.6*** as the action output.

üìíQuick Note: Since the `fail-when-version-not-found` input is not explicitly used in the YAML, the default value of `true` will be used and the job will fail if the version was not found.

``` yml
#Example 2 Workflow
- name: Get Version From C# Project File
    uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.2
    with:
        repo-owner: JohnDoe
        repo-name: MyRepo
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        branch-name: master
        file-format: xml # Not case sensitive
        file-path: "MyProject/MyProject.csproj"
        version-keys: "Version,FileVersion"
```
``` xml
<!--Example 2 - C# Project File-->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>
    <Version></Version> <!--No value. Search continues using the FileVersion key-->
    <FileVersion>4.5.6</FileVersion> <!--Key exists so this value is returned-->
</Project>
```

<div align="center">

### **Example 3 - (Key Case Sensitivity)**
</div>

Requirements:
- Search for a key without using case-sensitivity

Result:  
- The example below will use the value of ***1.2.3*** as the action output.

``` yml
#Example 3 Workflow
- name: Get Version From C# Project File
    uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.2
    with:
        repo-owner: JohnDoe
        repo-name: MyRepo
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        branch-name: master
        file-format: xml # Not case sensitive
        file-path: "MyProject/MyProject.csproj"
        version-keys: VeRSion # Different casing as the XML key below.
        case-sensitive-keys: false # Not required and has a default value of true.
```
``` xml
<!--Example 3 - C# Project File-->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>
    <version>1.2.3</version> <!--Spelling matches "VeRSion" but is still discovered.-->
</Project>
```

<div align="center">

### **Example 4 - (Branch Trimming)**
</div>

Requirements:
- Need to trim the value 'refs/heads/' from the beginning of the branch.

Result:  
- The example below will use the value of ***1.2.3*** as the action output.
- Click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) to get more information about the default variable used in the example below.

``` yml
#Example 4 Workflow
- name: Get Version From C# Project File
    uses: KinsonDigital/VersionMiner@v1.0.0-preview.2
    with:
        repo-owner: JohnDoe
        repo-name: MyRepo
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        branch-name: ${{ github.ref }} # If the branch was 'my-branch', this value could be 'refs/heads/my-branch'
        file-format: xml # Not case sensitive
        file-path: "MyProject/MyProject.csproj"
        version-keys: version
        trim-start-from-branch: "refs/heads/"
```
