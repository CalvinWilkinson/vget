<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ‚ú®</h2>

1. [#17](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/VersionMiner/issues/17) - Added create issue link to action console output.
    - Clicking this link will take you directly to the **create issue** page for the project.
2. [#45](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/VersionMiner/issues/45) - Added a new input named `trim-start-from-branch`.
    - This new feature will trim the value of the `trim-start-from-branch` input from the name of the `branch-name` input value.  This is useful to trim extra textual artifacts from the branch added by using **GitHub** default environment variables.
3. [#45](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/VersionMiner/issues/45) - Changed the `file-format` input to not use case sensitive values.
    - This means the value `xml` and `XML` are the same.  Previously it was case sensitive and a value like `XML` would of failed the workflow.
4. [#49](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/VersionMiner/issues/49) - Replace built in `GitHubDataService` related code with the new library [GitHubData](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/GitHubData).
5. [#48](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/VersionMiner/issues/48) - Added new action input named `repo-token`.
    - This adds the ability for **VersionMiner** to be able to make authenticated requests so the request rate limits are not reached when the action is executed.  Refer to the [GitHub API Authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#authentication) documentation for more information on request rate limits.
